# BudapestPublicTransportStops
Stops of the Budapest Public Transport network

This page aims to demonstrate the R binding of `leaflet` by displaying the public transport stops of Budapest, Hungary.

The original data files are available freely at BKK Centre for Budapest Transport [here](http://www.bkk.hu/gtfs/budapest_gtfs.zip).

According to the accompanying [page](http://www.bkk.hu/tomegkozlekedes/fejlesztoknek) the data is updated on a weekly basis,
and it conforms the [GTFS format](GTFS format documentation: https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference).

**NOTE**: this page uses only a snapshot of the data, so it may be out-of-date by the time you see it.

Each stop is displayed with the pictogram of its transport type, and when the cursor is hovered above them,
they display the number(s) of the route(s) and the name of the stop.
